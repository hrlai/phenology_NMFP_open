# Data and code for Lai, Hill, Stivanello and Chapman (2025) *J. Ecol.*

Welcome. Please find the phenological dataset for our paper in the `data` 
folder, and R scripts in the `code` folder. The main scripts are:

- `model.R` to fit the cosinor regression
- `results.R` to reproduce our figures, etc.

The remaining scripts are source codes used by `results.R`. We hope they help
you backtransform the cosinor parameters from the reparameterisesd model.

At the time of writing I did not have the luxury to check that the directory
paths are alright, please adapt them to your working directory. Apologies in
advance!
